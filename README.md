## Testings:

- I tested that this page works on different browsers: Chrome, Safari and Firefox

- I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the DevTools device toolbar

- I confirmed that the links in the navigation bar and the links to the social media work (social medias open in a new tab of the browser)

- I confirmed that the videos can be played and the sound works 

- I confirm that all the fields of the form work along with the submit button and successfully completing the form takes the user to the "Thank you" page

## Bugs:

### Solved:

- Found a bug where the "Hero" didn't appear on the image when the website was visited from a medium or small screen. 

    - Fixed by uploading a resized version of the same picture with new media queries for medium and small screens.
