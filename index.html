            <h2>Lead Climbing</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Lead climbing is a climbing style in which one climber has to take the lead while the other climbers
                follow.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Lead climber wears a harness attached to a climbing rope, which in turn is connected to the other
                climbers below the lead climber.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One of the climbers below the lead climber acts as a belayer. The belayer gives out rope while the lead
                climber ascends and also stops the rope when the lead climber falls or wants to rest.</p>

            <h2>Bouldering</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Bouldering is a form of climbing that is performed on rock formations or artificial rock walls without
                the use of ropes or harnesses.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Bouldering problems (the sequence of moves that a climber performs to complete the climb) are usually
                less than six metres (20ft) tall.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Bouldering competitions take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>

            <h2>Speed Climbing</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Speed climbing is a discipline in which speed is the ultimate goal.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It can be performed on rocks, walls and poles and is only recommended for highly skilled and experienced
                climbers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Competition speed climbing, which takes place on an artificial standardized climbing wall, is the main
                form of speed climbing. However, there are other variations of speed climbing that take place outdoors.
